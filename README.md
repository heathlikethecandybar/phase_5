# Diabetes Classification

**Author**: [Heath Rittler](mailto:hrittler@gmail.com)


## Overview




## Business Problem

An insurance company wants to develop a predictive model to assess the risk of diabetes among their policyholders based on a limited set of available data points. By accurately identifying individuals at high risk of developing diabetes, the company aims to take proactive measures to reduce healthcare costs and improve the overall health outcomes of their customers.

The challenge for the company is to build a robust and accurate predictive model that can handle the complexity and non-linear relationships between the available data points and the risk of developing diabetes. The model should consider factors such as age, gender, BMI, hypertension status, heart disease history, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. We will use a classification model to predict diabetes within the population of interest.

My background and work history has been in healthcare which makes this an interesting problem for me.  Being able to accurately predict risk within a population and provide resources and preventive measures are important now more than ever.


## Data

The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. This dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information. 

This can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes.

A link to the data can be found on Kaggle located here: 

The data are contained in a single file:

**diabetes_*prediction*_dataset.csv**

* `gender`
* `age`
* `hypertension`
* `heart_disease`
* `smoking_history`
* `bmi`
* `HbA1c_level`
* `blood_glucose_level`
* `diabetes`




Additional information about this dataset can be found on the [Kaggle](...) website. 


## Methods




## Results




## Conclusions & Recommendations

In conclusion, we were able to create a recommendation model that will accurately recommend movie titles to an end user.  By leveraging this model, the online streaming company will have an engagement tool they can use, and measure to gain additional users, and build loyalty within their existing user base. Moving forward, integrating and testing the recommendation algorithm will be key and are summarized below.
